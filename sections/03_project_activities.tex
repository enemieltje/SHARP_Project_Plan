\section{Project Activities}
% What are the steps to be taken to achieve the project results

% 1.	Orientation (0.5 months): Understanding the background, technologies, and project requirements.
% 2.	Conceptual Design (1.0 month): Development of multiple system architectures and trade-off analyses.
% 3.	Detailed Design (1.5 months/2 months): Mechanical and electrical design of the selected architecture.
% 4.	Manufacturing, Assembly, Integration, and Testing (1.0 month/1.5 months): Building and validating the integrated system.
% 5.	Reporting (1.0 month): Documenting and presenting the project outcomes.

% Orientation
%     Literature study on hydrogen storage, fuel cells, electric propulsion for drones
%     Determine mission scenario and scope of the prototype??
%     Create requirements for power system from mission scenario
%     Write Project Plan
% Design of test bench setup
%     Conceptual design of test bench setup
%     Trade-off and select best concept
%     Detailed design of test bench setup
% Building of test bench setup
%     Procurement of parts
%     Manufacturing and assembly of test bench setup
%     Integration of subsystems
% Testing of test bench setup
%     Test planning
%     Execution of tests
%     Analysis of test results
% Documentation and reporting of outcomes
%     Writing of research report
%     Preparation of presentations
%     Final review and submission

% Additional activities if time and budget allow:
% Design of drone prototype
%     Conceptual design of drone prototype
%     Trade-off and select best concept
%     Detailed design of drone prototype
% Building of drone prototype
%     Procurement of parts
%     Manufacturing and assembly of drone prototype
%     Integration of power system into drone
% Testing of drone prototype
%     Test planning
%     Execution of tests
%     Analysis of test results

The project is divided into multiple activities. The activities are organized into categories, so that each category is of a similar level of complexity. Note that some activities are dependent on other activities. This, along with the time constraints of each activity, is discussed in section 8 Planning. Each category also resembles the activities for a work package. A list of all work packages can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:Work Packages}.

If time allows, the scope of the SHARP-PS project can be extended, this will be discussed in more detail in section 4 Scope. Should this scope extension indeed be the case, this will lead to the following additional activities.
