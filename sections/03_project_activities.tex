\section{Project Activities}
% What are the steps to be taken to achieve the project results

% 1.	Orientation (0.5 months): Understanding the background, technologies, and project requirements.
% 2.	Conceptual Design (1.0 month): Development of multiple system architectures and trade-off analyses.
% 3.	Detailed Design (1.5 months/2 months): Mechanical and electrical design of the selected architecture.
% 4.	Manufacturing, Assembly, Integration, and Testing (1.0 month/1.5 months): Building and validating the integrated system.
% 5.	Reporting (1.0 month): Documenting and presenting the project outcomes.
