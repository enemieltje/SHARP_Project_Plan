\textit{
  This chapter should contain a description of the company,
  who they are and why do they want to do the project.
  Other stakeholders should also be mentioned and what interest they have in the project.
  A brief overview of the report structure can also be given here.

Talk about SSI, the development of (atmosphere breathing) propulsion systems for small satellites.
\\Development state of the valve and why testing it in a relevant environment is important.
\\Solid Flow and their CGG's which together with the valve can be a weight efficient fuel delivery system.
\\This would make for a nice aviation energy transition project, hence the drone.
\\This report is made in accordance with the guidelines in the book '\emph{Project Management}~\cite{Grit}.
