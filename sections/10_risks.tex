\section{Risks}
% What are reasons the project might fail
% What can we do about it
% Separate internal and external risks

% Run out of time
% Run out of money
% Technically more complex than anticipated
% Safety issues with hydrogen?

% Solid flow backing out
% Hardware acquisition difficulties/delays
% Dependency on external parties for certain parts of the project

\textit{
    Points of failure for the project should be identified here.
    Internal and external risks should be separated.
    Grit has a whole system on doing this, assigning a value for likelihood and impact to each risk.
}

Internal Risks
\begin{itemize}
    \item Running out of time
    \item Running out of budget
    \item Underestimation of technical complexity
    \item Safety issues related to hydrogen handling
\end{itemize}

External Risks
\begin{itemize}
    \item Solid Flow backing out of collaboration
    \item Delays in hardware acquisition/manufacturing
    \item Dependence on external parties for critical components
\end{itemize}
