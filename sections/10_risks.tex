\section{Risks}

In order to ensure the chance of success for this project is as high as possible, some of the major risks have been identified. Each risk has been assigned a level of likelihood and a level of impact. Furthermore, a mitigation strategy has been created for each risk in order to lower its likelihood, impact or both.

Risks have been separated into internal and external risks. Internal risks are managed by project members or stakeholders, while external risks are events that happen outside of the control of project members.
