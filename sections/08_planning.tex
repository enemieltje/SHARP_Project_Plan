In this chapter, all the activities from the work packages in Appendix B are listed along with their estimated hour requirement. As each of the work packages have a start and end date, these activities can be organised into a Gantt chart. This Gantt chart is shown here in figure~\ref{figure:gantt} and in appendix C.
