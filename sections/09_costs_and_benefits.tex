\section{Costs and Benefits}
% Do we know what the project will cost approximately
% Do we know what benefits the project will bring

% Costs will be labour hours
% Costs for test bench materials
% Fuel cell is especially expensive
% Costs for hydrogen fuel
% Possibly safety equipment/education costs
% later costs for drone prototype manufacturing and testing

% Benefits will be a practical testing environment for SSI valve
% Additional benefits might be sellable research
% Results might be a practical approach to electric flight, will SSI use that or sell it?
