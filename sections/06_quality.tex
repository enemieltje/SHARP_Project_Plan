To assure the quality of the project, each deliverable has been assigned at least one review method. For deliverables of the same type, the review methods are the same. Table~\ref{table:quality} lists the review methods that are assigned to each type of deliverable.

In addition to reviewing the quality of each deliverable, both quality and time are kept track of by weekly progress meetings with the company supervisor. This allows the company supervisor to provide feedback and advice and review the quality of the project as a whole on a weekly basis.
