When completed, each activity stated in section 3 produces a result in the form of a deliverable. Each deliverable is a tangible result and can be seen as a milestone within the project. When all the deliverables have been delivered, the project will be complete. The activities are grouped into work packages and as such the deliverables can also be grouped to the same work packages. The complete list of the work packages is shown in Appendix~\ref{app:Work Packages}.
