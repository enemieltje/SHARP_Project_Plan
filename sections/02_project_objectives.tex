\section{Project Results}
% Why the project is to be carried out
% What the project is to achieve
% Main and sub research questions

% Results may include some high level requirements, values do not need to be filled in yet
% "Power system must provide at least X Watts of power" is fine
% no need to define X yet, but is nice if possible

% Should be as 'SMART' as possible

% GOALS:
% Mainly test the SSI valve in a relevant environment
% Perhaps produce flight hours of the valve in a meaningful way
% Same goes for solid flow
% Secondary goals might be to help with energy transition in aviation
% Produce research on hydrogen based electric flight
% This research can be used to produce a sellable product or sold directly
% This selling is done to (partially) finance the testing of the SSI valve?

% RESULTS:
% Test bench setup
%     Hydrogen storage system (solid flow if available)
%     Hydrogen delivery system using SSI valve
%     Fuel cell system
%     Electric load, preferably as motor and propeller system
%     Integrated control system
%
% Research Report
%     Will answer main and sub research questions
%     To what extent is hydrogen KGG based electric flight feasible for drones
%     Must be in accordance with "Report writing for readers with little time" (Elling & Andeweg, 2012)
%
% Drone Design
%     Energy system from test bench
%     Either COTS drone or custom built drone
%     Integration of energy system into drone
%
% Drone Prototype (if achievable in time and budget)
%     Prototype manufacturing
%     Flight testing of drone

\textit{
    This chapter should contain a description of the project goals and results.
    It should describe what the project is to achieve and why the project is to be carried out.
    The main and sub research questions should also be given here.
